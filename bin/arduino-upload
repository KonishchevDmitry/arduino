# Uploads the specified *.ino file to Arduino
#
# It's recommended to make the following changes to /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Info.plist:
# * add -Dapple.awt.UIElement=true to disable bringing UI to front on each invocation (please notice that it breaks
#   application menu)
# * remove -splash:$APP_ROOT/Contents/Java/lib/splash.png to disable splash screen
#
# Any changes to Info.plist will break application sign and Firewall will constantly ask your permission for Arduino to
# access to Internet. So you should sign the modified version with your certificate by the following command:
# $ codesign -f -s $certificate_name /Applications/Arduino.app
#
# Certificate generation process:
# 1. Open Keychain Access.
# 2. Go to the Keychain Access menu, and under Certificate Assistant, choose Create a Certificate
# 3. Name your Certificate. (I recommend using something other than your first and last names)
# 4. For Type, choose Self Signed Root.
# 5. Make sure Let me override defaults is checked and click Continue.
# 6. Under Serial Number, use a random number. Just make sure there is no other certificate on your system with the same
#    name and serial number.
# 7. Give yourself a sufficiently long validity period.
# 8. Under Certificate Type, choose Code Signing, and click Continue.
# 9. Enter your personal information on the next screen. Have fun with Organization and Organizational Unit. After all,
#    this is for your own personal use. Don't use "Apple." I myself used something like "Orange Computer" for
#    Organization and "Hacking Department" for Organizational Unit. Click Continue when all has been filled out.
# 10. For Key Pair Information, accept the defaults and click Continue.
# 11. For Key Usage Extension, accept the defaults and click Continue.
# 12. For Extended Key Usage Extension, accept the defaults and click Continue.
# 13. For Basic Constraints Extension, accept the defaults and click Continue.
# 14. For Subject Alternate Name Extension, accept the defaults and click Continue.
# 15. Use your "login" keychain to store the certificate and click Continue.
# 16. Now you have to set your certificate to be "trusted."
# 17. Go to your keychain, and right click (control click) on the new certificate you made and choose Get Info.
# 18. Open the triangle next to Trust.
# 19. Go down to Code Signing, and choose Always Trust.
# 20. Close the box. The system will ask for your admin password. Enter it and click OK.
